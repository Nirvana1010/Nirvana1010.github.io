                We propose an innovative music genre classification method that

              <p>
                A novel evaluation approach was introduced to assess product

                approach employed CLIP object descriptions for input and FlanT5
                for caption generation, achieving top-notch captions
                <span class="bold">without training</span>. The second method
                utilized CLIP image features and text embeddings to fine-tune a
                pretrained GPT-2 model, achieving a
                <span class="bold">4-fold reduction in training time</span>
                compared to baselines while maintaining caption quality.

              <h3>Parallel Optimization for KNN</h3>
              <p>
                Totackles the challenge of prolonged running times in the
                <span class="bold">k-Nearest Neighbor (KNN) algorithm</span> as
                datasets grow larger, we propose a parallel approach that
                optimizes distance calculation and sorting using techniques like
                SIMD, loop unrolling, and multithreading. The strategy also
                <span class="bold"
                  >minimizes I/O latencies and incorporates parallel odd-even
                  and merge sort</span
                >
                for distance sorting. Experimental results show that our
                parallel KNN significantly reduces computation time while
                maintaining classification accuracy, offering an
                <span class="bold">4-times efficient</span> solution for larger
                datasets in KNN applications.
